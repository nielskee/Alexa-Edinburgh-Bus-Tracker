Pretty basic app to get the local bus times for you. Should be fairly straightforward to get up and running.

You'll need
* An Amazon Echo
* An Amazon AWS Account
* An Edinburgh Bus API Key (can be requested from here - http://www.mybustracker.co.uk/?page=API%20Key)

Simplest (and laziest) way is to copy the code straight over in the create AWS Lamdba workflow. You'll need the Utterances and intents when creating the Alexa Skillj.
